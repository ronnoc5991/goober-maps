# TODO

- add css reset
- add zoom to the canvas

- shift from drawing lines to drawing vertices
- determine what vertices (in map units) should be visible
- draw those vertices at the correct viewport coordinates

- draw a grid on the canvas...
- there needs to be an underlying coordinate system...
- latitudes and longitudes
- start out by drawing longitudes...
- how many longitudes are there? If the world is a sphere... there should be 360
- the real world is split by the prime meridian... from this point there are 180 degrees west and 180 degrees east...
- the prime meridian is at 0 degrees longitude...
- could represent the things as positive and negative numbers...
- positive would be to the east and negative would be to the west...
- ideally it should wrap around
